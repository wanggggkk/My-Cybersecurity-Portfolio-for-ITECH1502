# ITECH1502 Cybersecurity Fundamentals - Final Project: Cybersecurity Portfolio

## Project Title
**Mastering Network Reconnaissance: An In-Depth Port and Service Discovery using Nmap**

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

[cite_start]This project serves as the capstone assessment for the Federation University ITECH1502 Cybersecurity Fundamentals unit, demonstrating my ability to apply theoretical knowledge and practical skills[cite: 4]. [cite_start]This portfolio acts as a career-ready showcase to strengthen my professional profile for internships or entry-level cybersecurity roles[cite: 6].

[cite_start]**Training Platform:** TryHackMe [cite: 28]
**Challenge Room:** Further Nmap
[cite_start]**Core Topic:** Network Reconnaissance & Fundamental Vulnerability Scanning [cite: 14, 34]

## [cite_start]üéØ Project Goal/Objectives [cite: 52]

By completing the TryHackMe challenge, the project aimed to achieve the following:

1.  **Master Advanced Nmap Usage:** Learn and successfully apply advanced Nmap scan types, such as the SYN scan (`-sS`), and understand port range specification.
2.  **Accurate Service Identification:** Utilize Nmap's version detection feature (`-sV`) to accurately identify the service names and version numbers running on the target host's open ports.
3.  [cite_start]**Consolidate Foundational Skills:** Translate classroom theory into practical skills, strengthening the ability to utilize tools for information gathering in controlled environments[cite: 9, 14].

## [cite_start]üõ†Ô∏è Methodology [cite: 53]

The practical activity strictly followed a systematic network reconnaissance process, primarily using the **Nmap** tool.

1.  [cite_start]**Target Setup & Connection:** Register using the FedUni email and connect to the TryHackMe virtual machine environment[cite: 33].
2.  **Port Discovery (Stealth Scan):**
    * **Tool:** Nmap
    * **Command Example:** `nmap -sS <Target_IP>`
    * **Objective:** Use the stealthy SYN scan (`-sS`)‚Äîa faster and more inconspicuous method than a full TCP connect scan‚Äîto identify open ports.
3.  **Service and Version Detection:**
    * **Tool:** Nmap
    * **Command Example:** `nmap -sV -p <Ports> <Target_IP>`
    * **Objective:** Use version detection (`-sV`) to acquire precise service names and version numbers running on open ports, a crucial step for vulnerability identification.
4.  [cite_start]**Evidence Collection & Analysis:** Carefully analyse the Nmap output to extract necessary information, and collect screenshots of the work, including the FedUni email for verification[cite: 35, 55].

## üîç Outcomes & Key Findings

* **Skill Achievement:** Successfully applied Nmap's `-sS` and `-sV` parameters to accurately complete all network reconnaissance tasks on the target host.
* [cite_start]**Evidence:** [**Insert the link to the screenshot of your Nmap scan results here, ensuring your FedUni email is visible for verification** [cite: 35]].
* [cite_start]**Conclusion:** This practice activity successfully consolidated my understanding of the reconnaissance process and the application of basic security measures and tool utilization skills[cite: 13, 14].

## [cite_start]üß† Reflection & Professional Growth [cite: 56]

| Dimension | Reflection Summary | Unit Learning Outcomes (LO) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Learning Outcomes** | Gained a deep understanding of Nmap's core parameters (`-sS`, `-sV`) and their role in discovery vs. version identification. This practical work provided intuitive insight into the underlying TCP/IP protocol behavior during scanning. | [cite_start]LO S2: Utilise tools for vulnerability scanning and basic penetration testing[cite: 14]. |
| **Professional Growth** | [cite_start]**Blue Team Perspective:** Mastering Nmap helps me evaluate systems from an attacker's perspective, enabling me to better suggest mitigation strategies (A2) and apply basic security measures (A1)[cite: 15, 16]. [cite_start]This experience strengthens my career-ready showcase[cite: 6]. | [cite_start]LO A1 & A2: Apply cybersecurity measures to real-world scenarios and analyze case studies to suggest mitigation strategies[cite: 15, 16]. |
| **Future Improvements** | If repeated, I would integrate the Nmap Scripting Engine (`-sC`) to run automated checks against specific services (e.g., HTTP) to move beyond pure discovery into basic vulnerability assessment. | [cite_start]Addresses the reflection question on what would be done differently if the task were repeated[cite: 57, 58, 61]. |
