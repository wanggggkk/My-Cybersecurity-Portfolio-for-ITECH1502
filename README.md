# Welcome to My Cybersecurity Portfolio

Hello! I'm **zhiweixie**, a student in Federation University Australia's ITECH1502 Cybersecurity Fundamentals course. I'm passionate about exploring cybersecurity through hands-on practice. This portfolio presents projects, skills, and goals from my coursework and labs.

## Projects

> The projects below were completed during ITECH1502 and reflect hands-on learning. Replace placeholder screenshots and links with your actual artifacts and GitHub repository links.

### Vulnerability Scanning Exercise

* **Platform:** TryHackMe — *Nmap* room
* **Summary:** Practiced TCP/UDP port scanning, service/version detection and simple banner analysis.
* **Example command:**

```bash
nmap -sV -p- --open --reason -oN nmap_scan_results.txt target_ip
```

* **Notes:** Screenshots show open port 80 and potential information disclosure. Include your screenshots in the repository (e.g. `/assets/images/nmap-scan.png`).

### Incident Response Simulation

* **Platform:** LetsDefend
* **Summary:** Investigated simulated alerts, analysed logs, and drafted mitigation steps.
* **Artifacts:** Include a short timeline, key logs used, and remediation steps in your repo (e.g. `/projects/incident-response/`).

> *Add more project entries here (e.g., HackTheBox machine attempts, forensic case notes).*

## Learning Reflections

* **What I learned:** Hands-on scanning reinforced the role of vulnerability discovery in preventing attacks; I practiced common Nmap flags and learned to interpret scan output.
* **Growth:** Improved troubleshooting and analytical skills useful for SOC roles.
* **Next steps:** Attempt intermediate HackTheBox machines and explore Windows exploit development.

---

## Future Goals

* Achieve **CompTIA Security+** certification.
* Participate in more CTFs and HTB challenges.
* Apply for internships to gain real-world SOC/IR experience.

### How to use this page on GitHub Pages

1. Create a repository named `yourusername.github.io` (for a user site) or a project repo for a project site.
2. Add this file as `index.md` at the repository root.
3. Commit your images to `/assets/images/` and update the image paths in the markdown.
4. In repository settings enable **Pages** (use `main` branch and root folder) if needed.
5. Wait a few minutes and visit `https://yourusername.github.io` to see the site.
